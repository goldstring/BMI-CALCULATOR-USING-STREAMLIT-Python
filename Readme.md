## **Overview**
The **BMI Calculator using Streamlit** is a web-based application designed to calculate a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight. The app provides real-time BMI calculation and classifies the result into health categories such as:

- Overweight
- Various levels of obesity

This project demonstrates the use of **Python, Streamlit for UI components, and basic health data analytics**.

## **Key Features**
- Interactive input for height and weight.
- Immediate BMI calculation.
- Health classification based on BMI value.
- Simple and responsive user interface.

This project is an ideal showcase for creating lightweight, user-friendly data applications using Streamlit.
